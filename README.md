# MassPostCreator (v.1)
If you are tired of creating schedule post in your fanpage, you can upload them right from the .json! 

# How to use?
Inset your token from vk.com in the script and place url to json with post you want to schedule.
Your file must contains: 

  'data' - post publication date in unix format
  
  'photo' - adress of photo from vk.com (lifehack: import photo to your album and you will able to use mask "photoXXXXXX_XXXXXX")
